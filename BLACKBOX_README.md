## README.md

This repository contains the code for the [TensorFlow 2.0 Tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/).

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Tutorials

To run the tutorials, open a terminal window and navigate to the `tensorflow/examples/tutorials` directory. Then, run the following command:

```
python <tutorial_name>.py
```

For example, to run the [MNIST tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/), you would run the following command:

```
python mnist.py
```

## Tutorials

The following tutorials are included in this repository:

* [MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/mnist/): This tutorial introduces the basics of TensorFlow by building a neural network to classify handwritten digits.
* [Fashion MNIST](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/fashion_mnist): This tutorial is similar to the MNIST tutorial, but it uses a different dataset of clothing images.
* [Iris](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/iris): This tutorial shows how to build a simple neural network to classify flowers.
* [Text Classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification): This tutorial shows how to build a neural network to classify text data.
* [Image Classification](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/image_classification): This tutorial shows how to build a neural network to classify images.
* [Object Detection](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/object_detection): This tutorial shows how to build a neural network to detect objects in images.
* [Segmentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/segmentation): This tutorial shows how to build a neural network to segment objects in images.
* [Reinforcement Learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/reinforcement_learning): This tutorial shows how to build a reinforcement learning agent to play Atari games.
